## Features


- ### Image Playground
  Open and view up to four grayscale images simultaneously. No worries if they're colorful; we'll turn them into a grayscale masterpiece. All images play nice with consistent sizes, ensuring a clear and lively visual experience.
   
    - **No Colored Modee:** Magic wand that turns colored images into grayscale wonders.
    - **Unified Size:** All images join the same size party for a visually coherent extravaganza
    - **FT Components Showcase:** Each image flaunts fixed and dynamic displays, letting you switch between Fourier Transform components (Magnitude, Phase, Real, and Imaginary) with a wave of fun.

  
- ### Output Playgrounds
  Watch the mixer results unfold in two output viewports, mirroring the input playgrounds. You're the director; choose which viewport showcases the new mixer result.
   
- ### Brightness/Contrast Party
  Twist and turn the visual representation of images by tweaking brightness and contrast. All four Fourier Transform components join the party, offering flexibility in visualization.

- ### Components Mixer
  Create a blended masterpiece with an inverse Fourier Transform cocktail of the input four images. Intuitive sliders put you in control, customizing the weights for each image's Fourier Transform.

- ### Regions Mixer
  Draw rectangles to define regions for each Fourier Transform component. Inner or outer, your choice! The selected region lights up, giving all images a unified makeover.
- ### Real-time Jam
  The mixing process involves an ifft groove, and a progress bar keeps you in the loop. Interrupt the beat with a new mixing request? No problem, we cancel the previous operation intelligently.
